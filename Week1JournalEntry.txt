Week 1:
This week I used AI to assist me with the process of this assignment and to be more specific, I asked ChatGPT how to properly add a text file into my public repo
as I could not find the correct location at first. I did not use AI to actually complete this exercise, rather just assist me with the process of setting it up. Here is my AI chat link.

In addition to setting up this assignment, me and my group used AI as part of our decision making process on Wednesdays class, as we were unsure of which category to select for
our group project. Here is the link: https://chatgpt.com/share/68c70630-f534-8005-867a-cc99673406f2

Besides this, I did not use AI for any other assignments or assistance so far. I only used ChatGPT, and have not ventured out or compared any other Artificial Intelligence platforms
yet. That is all for my Week 1 Entry.
